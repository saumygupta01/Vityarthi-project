==> Problem Statement

Managing library books manually often leads to issues such as misplaced records, difficulty in tracking issued books, and loss of data. Traditional paper-based or temporary storage methods make it challenging to maintain accurate information about book availability, returns, and updates. There is a need for a simple digital system that can store and manage book records efficiently and permanently.

==> Scope of the Project

This project focuses on building a basic library management system that:
 > Stores book records (ID, Title, Author, Status) permanently using a CSV file.
 > Allows users to perform core operations like adding, searching, issuing, and returning books.
 > Works as a console-based application suitable for small libraries, classrooms, or personal collections.
 > Does not include advanced features like fines, user login, or multiple copies—but can be extended in the future.

==> Target Users

> Students learning Python and file handling.
> Teachers or librarians managing a small set of books.
> Developers looking for a simple mini-project.
> Anyone wanting a lightweight system without a database.

==> High-Level Features

> Add Book: Store new book details in the system.
> View Books: Display all stored books in a tabular format.
> Search Book: Find a book using its ID.
> Issue Book: Change status from "Available" to "Issued".
> Return Book: Update status back to "Available".
> CSV-Based Storage: Ensures permanent data saving.
