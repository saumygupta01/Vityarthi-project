=> Project Title
Library Management System 

=> Overview of the Project

The Library Management System is a simple Python-based application that helps manage books in a library. It allows users to add new books, view all records, search for books, issue books, and return issued books. All book information (ID, Title, Author, Status) is stored permanently in a CSV file, so the data remains even after closing the program. The system uses a menu-driven interface, making it easy to operate for beginners and students.

=> Features

> Add Book – Add new book records with ID, title, and author.
> View Books – Display all books in a formatted table.
> Search Book – Find a book by its ID.
> Issue Book – Mark a book as "Issued" if available.
> Return Book – Change status back to "Available".
> CSV-based Storage – Saves all updates permanently.

> CSV File for data storage (books.csv)
> Modules Imported:
   . csv
   . os
   . sys


==> Steps to Install & Run the Project

1. Install Python (if not already installed).
2. Create a project folder on your system.
3. Add the Python program file into the folder.
4. Place the books.csv file in the same folder.
5. Open a terminal/command prompt.
6. Navigate to the project folder.
7. Run the program using:
   -> python filename.py
8. Use the on-screen menu to perform operations.


==> Instructions for Testing

1. Add a few books and check if they appear in the list.
2. Search a book using its ID to confirm the search function works.
3. Issue a book, then view the list to check if its status changes to "Issued".
4. Return the same book, and verify the status changes back to "Available".
5. Close the program and run it again to confirm that all data is still stored in the CSV file.
